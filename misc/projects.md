# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using **only**:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

Some of these will be covered later in the course. Do not make any attempt to use them this week, even if you've used them before.

Make lots of little (but sensible!) git commits. The number of commits in your final submission is one of the criteria your work will be judged on. Although it's not necessary to push to Github every time you commit, you should still push regularly to make sure everything is backed up remotely.

## Briefs

The briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

## Submission

Submit a link to your Github repo through the Homework Submission form as soon as the repo has been created.

On Friday there will be an opportunity for a one-to-one retrospective with an instructor. You'll have the chance to get some feedback on your project and discuss what went well and what could have gone better.

## Presentation

Presentations will be held on Thursday. You will have 10 minutes to present your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:

* Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
* Demonstrate your app's functionality
* Talk about some code that you are particularly proud of
* Highlight your main learning points

Do not:

* Talk through every single line of code
* Go over the time limit

We're interested in finding out about the process you went through with this project, not how shiny your presentation is. You can produce a slideshow if you like, but if you're more comfortable showing code in a text editor then that's fine.

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practise self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What do you think the problem is?
* What have you tried so far?
* What did Google say about your error message?

## Attendance

Attendance isn't compulsory this week, but remember that it's not a week off! Even if you're working form home, we still expect you to be working on your project. It's also very difficult for the instructors to provide support remotely. We'll do our best, but the best way of getting help is face-to-face where we can work through the problem together.

If you are coming in we'll have stand-up each day at the usual time. If you're not coming in then let us know via Slack - we need to keep track of who's meant to be in for Health & Safety reasons.
